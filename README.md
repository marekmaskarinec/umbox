# UmBox

![](etc/cat.png)

UmBox is a package manager for Umka programs and libraries. It allows you to
easily install and update libraries, including their dependencies. UmBox offers
a CLI tool (hosted in this repo) and a Web UI (hosted in the
[umboxs](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/umboxs) repo). The Web UI can be
used to search for packages and to browse their documentation, which is
automatically generated based on the [MMDOC](https://git.sr.ht/~mrms/mmdoc)
syntax.
